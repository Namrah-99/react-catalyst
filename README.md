Welcome to my collection of mini React projects! This repository contains a series of small projects built using React along with Redux for state management, React Query for data fetching and caching, and React Router DOM for routing. Each project focuses on a specific concept or feature, demonstrating how to implement them in a practical and concise manner.

Projects Included:

- [react-bits-and-pieces](https://react-bits-and-pieces.vercel.app/):  This is a collection of reusable and valuable React components, even though they are of small-scale nature, but you can build vast world of functionalities with these fundamental components.
- [react-ecomm-app](https://react-catalyst.vercel.app/) (in-progress):  React e-commerce application under development leveraging Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and DaisyUI for a jumpstart on UI components. It's in progress, just built the UI, now working on its backend.
- [react-journey-mapper](https://react-journey-mapper.vercel.app/):  A small react app tracks cities visited with visit dates and details, showing countries traveled. It includes a map where users can add comments about their visits by selecting a place.
