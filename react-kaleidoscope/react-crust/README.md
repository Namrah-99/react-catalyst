## Technology Stack Analysis Based on Your `package.json` File
The `package.json` file reveals the following key aspects of your React application's technology stack:

Frontend:
- Framework: React (version ^18.2.0) - The core library for building user interfaces.
- State Management: Redux Toolkit (version ^2.2.1) - A streamlined library for managing application state.
- Routing: React Router DOM (version ^6.22.1) - Handles navigation between different views in the single-page application.

Development Tools:
- Build Tool: Vite (version ^4.4.5) - A modern frontend build tool for fast development experience.
- Linting: ESLint (version ^8.56.0) - Ensures code quality by enforcing style and formatting rules.
- ESLint Plugins:
  - eslint-config-react-app (version ^7.0.1) - Provides a pre-configured set of ESLint rules optimized for React development.
  - eslint-plugin-react (version ^7.32.2) - Caters to React-specific code linting.
  - eslint-plugin-react-hooks (version ^4.6.0) - Focuses on linting React functional components using Hooks.
  - eslint-plugin-react-refresh (version ^0.4.3) - Enables hot module replacement for faster development.
- Formatting: Prettier (version ^3.2.5) - Auto-formats code for consistent style.
- Styling:
  - Tailwind CSS (version ^3.4.1) - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
  - Autoprefixer (version ^10.4.17) - Adds vendor prefixes to CSS styles for wider browser compatibility (optional with Tailwind CSS).
  - PostCSS (version ^8.4.35) - A CSS preprocessor for advanced features (optional with Tailwind CSS).
  - prettier-plugin-tailwindcss (version ^0.5.11) - Integration between Prettier and Tailwind CSS for consistent formatting.

- Data Storage:
The provided package.json doesn't explicitly show dependencies for data storage. The app might be using:
  - In-memory storage: For a simple prototype, the data could be stored directly in the application's memory during runtime.
  - Local storage (browser): Data can be persisted across sessions using the browser's local storage API.
  - Backend API: If the app scales significantly, a backend API (e.g., Node.js) might manage data in a database.

- Additional Notes:
  - The type": "module" field indicates the project uses the ECMAScript modules syntax.
  - The provided scripts offer functionalities for development (dev, lint), building (build), and previewing (preview) the application.

This technology stack provides a solid foundation for building a modern and interactive React application like the described Foodie app. The use of Vite ensures a fast development experience, while Redux Toolkit facilitates efficient state management. The combination of React Router DOM, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint plugins streamlines routing, styling, and code quality.

## Usage: 
This small food app allows users to view and interact with a variety of meal options. Users can:

- View all available meals
- Search for specific meals using a search bar
- Add or delete meal items from the main meal list page
- Add meal items to their cart
- View all meal items in their cart on the cart page
- Place an order after confirming their meal items
- Provide their phone number and delivery address for order delivery
- Set a priority for their order if they want it to be processed quickly
- View a receipt for their order on a new page

## Target Audience:
- This app is ideal for small restaurants or food vendors looking for a simple online ordering solution.
- It can also be a learning project for developers to practice building a fully functional React application with user interactions and data management.
